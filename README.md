## Key Insights
-The business generated $1.10M in total sales, indicating strong overall revenue performance across regions and segments.
-The West and East regions contribute the highest share of total sales, while Central and South regions lag behind.
-California and New York are the top-performing states, contributing significantly more revenue than other states.
-The Consumer segment accounts for the largest portion of sales (~50%), followed by Corporate customers.
-Standard Class shipping is the most frequently used mode, suggesting customer preference for cost-effective delivery options.
-A small number of products generate a large share of revenue, indicating a Pareto effect (top products drive most sales).

## Business Recommendations
-Increase marketing spend and inventory allocation in West and East regions, as they contribute the highest share of sales.
-Introduce targeted promotions and region-specific offers in Central and South regions to improve sales performance.
-Prioritize stocking and promoting top-selling products, while reviewing or bundling low-performing products to improve overall revenue.
-Review discount strategies in regions with high sales but low profit to enhance overall profitability.
-Since the Consumer segment contributes the majority of sales, design loyalty programs and personalized offers to retain these customers.


## Deliverables

## Outcome
This analysis provides actionable insights to help businesses improve sales strategy, regional performance, and profitability.
